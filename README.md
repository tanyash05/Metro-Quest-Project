# Metro-Quest-Project

This is a C++ program which will take information of the source and the destination station from the user and will display the fare and shortest way to reach the destination station. It also has a map for better navigation.

The code is implemented using Graph and Priority Queues. Nodes of the graph represent a station that will contain information regarding the station. Edges (the connection between two nodes) of the graph represent the distance between the two stations. The cost of each edge will be equal to the distance between the two of its connecting stations(nodes).

Dijkstra algorithm, breadth-first search, depth-first search, are used in implementation of this code.
